### About Neward & Associates
Neward & Associates, LLC, is the business entity within which Ted conducts much of his consulting, writing, and speaking activities. Essentially a "Company of One and a Half", Neward and Associates nevertheless maintains close and intimate connections with some of the biggest and brightest names in the software industry, and will often bring them to bear on a project as the client's and project's needs dictate. Don't worry--the "Company of One and a Half" is just reflective of the agility and size of the organization, not the firepower that can be brought to bear on your problem.

If you're looking for Ted's bios, you have four to choose from: the "really short", the "short", the "humorous", and the "long-winded" versions.

### Really Short

Ted is a big geek.

### Short

Ted Neward is an industry professional of twenty years' experience. He speaks at conferences all over the world and writes regularly for a variety of publications across the Java, .NET, and other ecosystems. He currently resides in the Pacific Northwest with his wife, two sons, three cats, twelve laptops, seven tablets, nine phones, and a rather large utility bill.

### Humorous

Ted Neward is sometimes referred to as "The Dude of Software", owing to both his remarkable (some say frightening) resemblance to the Jeff Bridges character from "The Big Lebowski", and his ordination as a Dudeist Minister of the <a href="http://www.dudeism.org">Church of the Latter-Day Dude</a>, but he's also been called the "Dr. Gregory House of Software", owing to his tendency to pull no punches when talking about software and how to deliver it successfully. He's comfortable answering to either title, as well as a few others. He's familiar with more programming languages than most people knew existed, and hasn't found one yet that he couldn't turn into a 'mission-critical' application when asked.

### Long

Ted Neward currently labors on his own behalf, leveraging his speaking, writing, and coding experience to bring a technology-focused and -sharpened mindset to the mortgage industry. During his more code-focused years, he specialized in high-scale enterprise systems, working with clients ranging in size from Fortune 500 corporations to small 10-person shops. He is an authority in Java and .NET technologies, particularly in the areas of Java/.NET integration (both in-process and via integration tools like Web services), programming languages of all forms, back-end enterprise software systems, and virtual machine/execution engine plumbing.

He is the author or co-author of several books, including [Professional F# 2.0](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-F-2-0.productCd-047052801X.html), [Effective Enterprise Java](http://www.awprofessional.com/title/0321130006), [C# In a Nutshell](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csharpnut), [SSCLI Essentials](http://www.newardassociates.com/files/SSCLI2.pdf), [Server-Based Java Programming](http://www.manning.com/books/neward3), and a contributor to several technology journals. All told, he has written well over a hundred articles in both print and online form.

Ted has also been an "insider" of one form or another with a variety of the technology providers of the world: an IBM Champion of Cloud, a Microsoft F# MVP (having also been an Architect and C# MVP in prior years), an F# Insider, C# Insider, VB Insider, INETA speaker, DevelopMentor instructor, PluralSight course author, and a member of various Java JSRs.

He lives in the Pacific Northwest with his wife, two sons, three cats, twelve laptops, seven tablets, nine phones and a rather large utility bill.
