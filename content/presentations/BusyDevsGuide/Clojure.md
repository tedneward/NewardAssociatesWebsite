"Clojure is a Lisp." That's the first answer one usually gets when asking what, exactly, Clojure is. But in a lot of ways, that's an overly simplified answer, and it doesn't really doesn't really do the language justice. In this talk, we'll talk about Clojure for the non-Java developer, why it would be interesting even to those not running on the JVM, and what being "a Lisp" really means (besides Lots of Irritating Silly Parentheses).
