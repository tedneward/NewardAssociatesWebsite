Statistically speaking, developers--particularly those with a few years under their belt--find the idea of "giving back" to be not just appealing, but a necessity. Sadly, desptte the genuine good intentions, most developers have no idea how to mentor a younger developer, and often flounder and stumble and make a mess of things. In this presentation, we'll talk about what mentoring is, how to do it successfully, and how to get started with it even if your company has no formal mentoring program.
