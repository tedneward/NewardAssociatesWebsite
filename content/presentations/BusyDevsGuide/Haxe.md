The Haxe programming language is a relative newcomer to the programming field, but provides one thing rare to languages--a deliberate and calculated strategy to work seamlessly with all of them. (Well, most of them, anyway.) In this presentation, we'll talk about the core Haxe syntax, how to get started, and how to make the most of this interesting language that knows how to speak C#, Java, Python, PHP, and Node, natively.
