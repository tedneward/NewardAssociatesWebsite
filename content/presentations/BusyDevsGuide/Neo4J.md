Ever tried to store a graph in a relational database? Something like an ancestry tree, or even the reporting structure of the average corporation? Noticed how the "shape" of the data (the graph) doesn't quite line up anywhere close to the shape of your traditional RDBMS? This is because there is an impedance mismatch between the two, and the best way to make that pain go away is to make the right choice in data storage tools--in this case, a graph databae like Neo4J. In this presentation, we'll examine Neo4J, what it means to use a graph database, when it works well, when you might avoid it, and most of all, how to get started with it without losing a ton of time or momentum on your next project.
