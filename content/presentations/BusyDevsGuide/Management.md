Ah, managers. Team leads, if you prefer. People who have the hiring (and firing) authority over others within the company, and are ostensibly tasked with.... Wait, what do managers do again? Is it something you were thinking about doing? Is it something any right-minded developer would want to do? Or is it the logical next step in a career path that feels like it's stalled out at "architect"? Or, perhaps, *gulp*, "help, I've been promoted, now what"? 

In this talk, we'll take a realistic look at software development management, both good and bad, and help you decide how to work with them, whether you want to become one of them, and how to make the leap to management when you're ready to do so.
