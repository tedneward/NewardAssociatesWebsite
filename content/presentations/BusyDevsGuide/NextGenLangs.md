Remember when TypeScript, or C#, or even C++ was new, and you wished you'd known they were going to "be big" so you could be the person ahead of the curve instead of struggling to catch up to where everybody else seemed to be already? The world-famous hockey player Wayne Gretzky, when asked what made him different than all the other players, famously said, "I didn't skate to where the puck was--I skated to where the puck would be." In this presentation, we're going to take a look at a few languages that incorporate concepts that might--with heavy emphasis on the word "might" in that sentence--be where the puck will figuratively end up. These languages may not be what you end up using in your day job in 2025, but they could be exposing and refining the concepts that define the language that will.
