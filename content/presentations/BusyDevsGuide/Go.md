In the mid-2010's, Google announced a new programming language, Go, and the collective reaction of most of the programming world was a giant yawn. Yet another language, and even though it came from some serious industry veterans--Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike--it didn't really seem to be bringing all that much that was new or intersting to the table.
By 2015, that tune had changed. Go is now one of the "up-and-comers" in the programming language world, and it owes its success to a variety of factors. In this presentation, we're going to take a hard look at the language, go over what it has (and what it lacks!), what makes it interesting, and get comfortable with some of the syntax basics, as a "first steps" towards building non-trivial Go programs in the future. It's probably not the last programming language you'll ever learn, but it is definitely on of the few that you should learn.
