JavaScript frequently confuses developers, with its odd language rules and inconsistent approach to various aspects of the language. TypeScript is an attempt to clean up the language, simplifying it and creating a syntax easier to understand and use, but that compiles down to native JavaScript for widespread use in the browser (and anywhere else JavaScript is expected). In this session, we'll go over the syntax, semantics and implications of TypeScript, and more.
