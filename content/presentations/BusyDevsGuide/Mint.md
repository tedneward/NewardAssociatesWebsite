Building Web applications has always been a strange affair--HTML, JavaScript, CSS, all mixed together, and often "supporting" languages (like XML) thrown in to somehow make the whole thing "easier". Back in the GUI development days, we used one, maybe two languages tops (your favorite O-O language of choice, and maybe--much later--XML to define the UI in declarative ways). Woudn't it be nice to have an all-in-one solution that could be compile-time checked and managed as a first-class solution? Mint (the programming language, not the Linux distribution) bills itself as that exact solution: Mint is "the programming language for writing single page applications" and "has all the tools you need to write error free, easily readable and maintainable applications in record time."

In this presentation, we'll take a look at Mint: the syntax, the semantics, and the benefits--in particular, the ability to build a non-trivial single-page application website in thousands of lines of Mint code, as opposed to ten times that in your favorite SPA framework.
