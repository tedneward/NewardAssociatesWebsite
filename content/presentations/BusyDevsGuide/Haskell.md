Ever wanted to play with a language that has no side effects, no mutable state, and a ton fewer bugs because of it? In this session, we take a programmer journeyman's (as opposed to an academic's) approach to the Haskell programming language, and discover what "pure functional", "lazy" and "strict" mean when talking about programming languages. Buckle up, because this is going to be an interesting ride.
