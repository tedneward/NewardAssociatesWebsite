Python is a general-purpose dynamically-typed programming language and platform that provides a rich ecosystem of powerful features and libraries. Making use of "significant whitespace" to denote scope blocks (instead of lexical markers), Python is relatively easy for the developer to pick up, and Python's success in the world of "data science" makes it a great "second language" for any developer. In this presentation, we'll go over the core Python syntax, how to get started on your Python journey, and some of the tools and libraries available.
