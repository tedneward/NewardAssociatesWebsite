Python is a general-purpose programming language and platform that provides a rich ecosystem of powerful features and libraries. As a dynamically-typed object-oriented language using "significant whitespace" to denote scope blocks (instead of lexical markers), Python is relatively easy for the developer to pick up, and Python's success in the world of "data science" makes it a great "second language" for any developer.
