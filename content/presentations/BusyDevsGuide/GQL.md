GQL is the latest ISO standard database query language, a peer to SQL, but for querying and interacting with graph data, rather than the relational data its cousin SQL handles. In this presentation, we'll go over the basics of a graph database, get started with GQL syntax, and explore how graph data differs and is similar to relational data and databases.
