As a dynamically-typed object-oriented language with some flexible syntactic constructs and a deep ecosystem of powerful libraries and tools, Ruby is a good tool to know, regardless of your preferred platform. In this presentation, we'll go over some core Ruby syntax, how to get started with Ruby, and how Ruby can fit in to an existing technology stack without forcing a rewrite of everything.
