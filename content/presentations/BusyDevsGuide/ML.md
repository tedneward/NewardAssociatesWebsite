Machine Learning? Heavens, no! ML (the predecessor to OCaml, which in turn gave us F#, among other things) is, in many ways, the world's original functional language. As a pure functional language, learning ML can help understand functional languages more clearly and distinctly, without any attempt to try to bind to objects or use object syntax. In this presentation, we'll explore ML, not because you're going to build your next mobile app with it, but because it will help you understand the language and platform you use to build your next... anything.
