Firebase is a document-oriented database (owned by Google) that offers up some impressive data-sync capabilities that make it a natural fit for mobile applications, as well as apps that need to have some near-real-time data exchange. Plus, it's not nearly as hard to learn as that description may imply. In this session, we'll go over Firebase, how to use it, where it works well, and where you might want to go with other options.
