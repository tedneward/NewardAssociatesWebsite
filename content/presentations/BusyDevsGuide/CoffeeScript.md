JavaScript frequently confuses developers, with its odd language rules and inconsistent approach to various aspects of the language. CoffeeScript is an attempt to clean up the language, simplifying it and creating a syntax easier to understand and use, but that compiles down to native JavaScript for widespread use in the browser (and anywhere else JavaScript is expected). In this session, we'll go over the syntax and semantics of CoffeeScript, how to use it in a Web application, why it makes the code and more.
