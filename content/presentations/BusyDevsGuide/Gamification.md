Is it the business of business to play games? Innovative startups like FourSquare, GoWalla, Yelp, and more certainly think so, and based on their growth curves, lots of other people do too. In this talk, we'll discuss 'gamification', adding game elements to otherwise non-game software and systems: why you might do it, what it is, how to do it, and what sort of ideas different businesses or systems might take to 'gamify' themselves. By the time we're done, you'll never look at a business app quite the same way again.
