As the world moves to more and more functional concepts and style, perhaps it's time to consider using a purely-functional language on your next project. But the cost of switching away from your current platform is so painful and unacceptable....
Relax! As numerous languages have already demonstrated, it's possible to have your (functional) cake and eat it (on your platform of choice) too!
Frege is a pure-functional language for the Java Virtual Machine, based strongly on the Haskell programming language, and more importantly, interoperates with the entirety of the Java ecosystem. In this session, we're going to look at Frege, examine its syntax and semantics, and spend some time learning what a "pure functional" language really means.
