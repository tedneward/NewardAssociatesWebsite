Ever wondered if there was a way to build a tool such that normal people--everyday users that had little-to-no background in programming or technology--could customize or control how the computer behaves? It's the "holy grail" of the DSL community, and we may have accidentally developed the closest thing to it, but ignored it because for years it's been hiding in the world of "interactive storytelling" as a game engine. In this presentation, we'll take a look at Inform7, an interactive storytelling engine and language that has quietly allowed game designers to program interactive games (think Zork) without needing to know a lick of any programming language. What can we learn from it, and what can we use it for?
