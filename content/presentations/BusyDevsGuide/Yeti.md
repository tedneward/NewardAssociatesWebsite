In 1993, when object-oriented programming was new, initiates to the idea were told to "go learn Smalltalk if you really want to 'get' objects", on the grounds that abandoning traditional procedural ideas found in C and Pascal were really the best ways to grok object-oriented. Heard all about this functional programming thing? Interested in getting to the heart of functional programming, abandoning all that you know from the object-oriented world, to try and grok functional? Then Yeti, a pure functional language running on top of the JVM, with deep ties back to ML (another pure functional language) may be the right place to be.
