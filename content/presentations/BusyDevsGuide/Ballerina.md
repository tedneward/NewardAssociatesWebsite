Despite the frivolity implies by its name, Ballerina, like the dancers who bear the same name, is a graceful language with surprising elegance and strength inside a slender frame. Still (as of this writing) a self-described "work in progress", Ballerina is a language designed from the ground up for the world of Web 2.0, with built-in support for HTTP endpoints, JSON data types, and an input format--either textual or graphical--that makes it perfect for building platform clients and implementations. In this session, we will go over the Ballerina language and environment, and explore what a language "built for the Web" looks like.
