Flutter is Google's entry into the world of cross-platform mobile tools, for building applications that stretch across Android and iOS from a single codebase. Built using the Dart programming language, Flutter offers a new way into the mobile world that requires no knowledge of ViewControllers, MVC, or Activities. But while Flutter might sound like "yet another HTML/CSS/Javascript for mobile" tool, it's most certainly a different breed of cat, and its internal architecture allows it to do some unusual things, including the ability to "hot reload" an application during development--without losing running state.
