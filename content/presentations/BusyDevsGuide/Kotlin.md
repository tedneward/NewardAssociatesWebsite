With the release of Kotlin, JetBrains makes its first serious dive into the programming language space, and by all accounts, it's quite a graceful dive. Kotlin integrates much of the object-oriented thinking over the last thirty years together with several new ideas from the world of functional programming to create a language that is much of the best of both worlds, without the ceremony and legacy that bedevils them. No language is perfect, and Kotlin certainly has its quirks, but in this session we will go over Kotlin's syntax and semantics, and who knows? Maybe this becomes your next language of choice.
