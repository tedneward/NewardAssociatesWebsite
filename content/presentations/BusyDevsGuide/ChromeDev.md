When Google introduced Chrome, the world pretty much took it on faith that it would look to adhere to the Web standards: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and others. And when Google sought to give developers opportunities to extend the browser using browser-specific extension points, it was nothing more subversive than what Microsoft, Firefox, Netscape or Apple had done before. But Google chose to use the same tools--HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and others--to provide those extensions, and in some ways, avoided some of the pain points that previous native-code-based browser extensions ran into. In this talk, we're going to examine the tools and APIs that a developer can use to build a Chrome extension--and when they can be useful, and when they just annoy people.
