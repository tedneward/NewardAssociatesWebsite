OAuth is an authentication protocol designed to make it easier to allow different systems to interact with one another without having to share secrets (in the form of user passwords) with one another--in short, it's a "federated authentication system", and it's in wide use across the Internet. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and thousands more popular Internet destinations are using it as a way of identifying their users, and if you want to tap in to it, it's actually not nearly as hard as it sounds from the documentation. In this session, we'll walk through the OAuth protocol, how it works, what it defends against (and what it doesn't), and how to enable your website or mobile app to take advantage of it.
