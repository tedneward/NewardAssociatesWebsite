F# is a new programming language incorporating the most important concepts of object-oriented and functional languages and running on top of the CLR as standard assemblies. Sporting the usual object-oriented concepts as classes and inheritance, F# also offers a number of powerful functional features, such as algebraic data types, immutable objects by default, pattern matching, closures, anonymous functions and currying, and more. Combined with some deep support for the CLR and .NET class libraries, F# offers .NET programmers an opportunity to write powerful programs with concise syntax for a new decade of .NET programming. In this presentation, we focus on the parts of F# that form the "foundation" of the language, such as its data types, type-inference, and flow control constructs, from basic decision making (if/else) to more advanced constructs like like pattern-matching.
