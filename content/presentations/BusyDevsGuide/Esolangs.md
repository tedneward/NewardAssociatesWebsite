WARNING: This talk is not for the faint of heart.

In this presentation, we will examine the realm of the "esoteric" language: the programming language that is designed not to be useful, or productive, but to tease, punish, or mystify the programmer. Usually for fun.

Somebody's dark, deeply-twisted, sado-masochistic idea of "fun".

You have been warned.
