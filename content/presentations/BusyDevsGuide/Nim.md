Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula, and supports a large number of interesting features that put it on par with C++ or Rust as a systems-level programming language. In this presentation, we'll be taking a look at how to get started, and just enough syntax and semantics to begin your Nim journey.
