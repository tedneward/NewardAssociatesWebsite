For most software projects, that classic 3-layered/n-tiered "box-arrow-box-arrow-cylinder" architecture suffices to provide all the flexibility the application needs. Unfortunately, that strategy, though elegant in its simplicity, doesn't work everywhere and all the time--various factors require data to be scattered, gathered, sliced, diced, spread, and/or concentrated. So what do we do when the traditional approaches no longer fly?

In this presentation, we're going to take a look at a couple of different options--architecture, patterns, technologies, and protocols--that provide options for the developer and/or architect. It's not that the 3-layered/n-tiered approach is bad, it's just that sometimes, it's not sufficient, and when that happens, it's always good to have options in your pocket, just in case.
