MongoDB is a scalable, high-performance, document-oriented, language/platform-agnostic, schema-free, open-source, native, fast "NoSQL" database that offers a completely different view of how we store data. Built to focus on problems that traditionally have stymied the relational database, Mongo represents a challenge to the developer: it's got a lot of power and promise, but only if she can understand this completely different approach to data persistence, retrieval, and storage. In this session, we'll tackle that precise challenge: to understand how Mongo works and get started working with it, including how to put data into it, find data within it, and so on. Come with an open mind (and maybe a laptop to code alongside as we go).
