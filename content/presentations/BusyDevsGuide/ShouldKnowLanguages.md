In the "Pragmatic Programmer", Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt suggest that every programmer should learn a new programming language every year--but they don't tell you which ones to learn! And in a world with so many different programming languages, it can be hard to figure out what to study next. Do you go after Swift? Kotlin? Rust, or Nim, or Zig? Do you pursue one of the "critic's darlings" like Elixir or Erlang, or do you take a page from history and learn something from our ancient past, like FORTRAN or COBOL?

In this presentation, we're going to identify a path for developers to learn languages which challenge our preconceptions, get us to embrace some new ideas, but always with an eye towards the practical. After all, learning an obscure language is fun, but learning an obscure language that helps open our minds to wild new concepts that we can use in our everyday work... that's gold.
