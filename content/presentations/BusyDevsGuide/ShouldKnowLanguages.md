The programming industry is approaching the end of its first century of existence, and along the way numerous languages (even platforms) have been invented, popular, and then put aside as newer and shinier languages emerged. Some of these languages, though, still send ripples through the industry today, and knowing them means you understand how they influence the languages (and idioms and patterns and designs) that you use today.

In this talk, we're going to step into the Wayback Machine, and explore these languages, why they were interesting, and what you can learn from them that will influence and shape the way you use the languages you're using today.
