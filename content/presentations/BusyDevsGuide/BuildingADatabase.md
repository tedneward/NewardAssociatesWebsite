We use them all the time, but we're often not quite sure how they work. Submit a string formatted "just so", and receive back in mere microseconds a set of results that are laid out in a manner that's useful to us. Whether you use a relational database, graph, or even one of the most basic key-value stores, the engineering that goes into a database feels like Dark Arts. Except, they're not. In this session, we'll talk about the internals of a database--and the steps required to build your own, just for kicks (and education).
