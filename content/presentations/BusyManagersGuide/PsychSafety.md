Unless you've been under a rock this past decade, you've probably run across the term "psychological safety"; the tech industry largely ignored it, until Google and Microsoft ran some research to find out what makes a software team click, and discovered that more than training, hiring, or methodology, it was... you guessed it... psychological safety.
In this presentation, we're going to dive straight in to the concept--what it is, why it's so powerful, and what it looks like when a team has it. More importantly, we'll talk about how you, as a manager of your team, can build psychological safety for your team, and preserve it against the forces that would (intentionally or accidentally) tear it away.
