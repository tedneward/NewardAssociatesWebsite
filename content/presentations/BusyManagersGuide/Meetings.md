Meetings! Clearly, if there is one topic that everyone inside of a technology organization loves to hold up as the single most responsible thing for why nothing gets done, it's the loathesome meeting. Too many long meetings, too many people in meetings, too many boring meetings, too many... meetings.

And yet? They're a necessary and critical part of getting our job done, as evidenced by the fact that whenever we get stuck, we call a meeting. We walk over to a coworker's desk, we put a message into Slack, we send an email... we do dozens of things that are all meetings--but without the PowerPoint.

What if the problem isn't the meeting, but the way we understand and practice them?

In this talk, we'll go over meetings--the good, the bad, the ugly--and talk about how you, as a leader of your team and in your company, can make sure your meetings don't suck.
