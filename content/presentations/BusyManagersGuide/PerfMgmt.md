It is said that the performance of a manager (team lead, tech lead, leader, etc) is the same as the performance of their team. If that's the case, and you lead a team of developers, then suddenly your bonus--and promotions--are in the hands of a group of people whose actions you don't directly control. Is it any wonder why micromanagement on software teams is so rampant?

In this presentation, we'll talk about the tools by which a team lead/software development manager can not only get the best out of the team. And what to do when they don't meet the necessary expectations. And help the team grow and get stronger to boot. And more.
