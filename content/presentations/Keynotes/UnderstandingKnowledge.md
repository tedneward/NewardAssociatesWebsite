Philosophy: ancient Greek for "love of wisdom", philosophy is the study of the general and fundamental nature of reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind and language.
Psychology: the science of the brain, emotions, and behavior.
Programming: ancient Latin for "please God let it compile this time".

As developers, we wrestle with the concept of "knowledge" and "understanding" all the time, yet we never truly understand or know what it is we're working with. Philosophers and psychologists spend extraordinary amounts of time in these concepts, and it's high time we take a moment and explore what they know that we don't.

Oh, and along the way, we'll reclaim the concepts of domain models, performance metrics, and software estimates, just for fun.
