What is the role of an architect in a software project? This question has plagued many a software organization (and even those who do the job), and provided loads of entertainment. In this presentation, we aim to explore the intersection of software architect with the worlds of architecture, psychology, business, and even music. By the end, though, you'll have a clear idea of what an architect is, does, and needs.
