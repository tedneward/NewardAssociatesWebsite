For so many years, developers have been taught by the "craftsmen" of the world that quick-and-dirty is a sin, an evil that must be rooted out and destroyed wherever it is found. What if I told you that not only is quick-and-dirty not the outright abomination that "thought leaders" make it out to be, but a necessary tool to have... and should be a critical component of every project you build from here on out?
