Thanks to the plateau of per-chip performance increases and the resulting need to work better with multi-core CPUs, the relative difficulty of mapping user requirements to general-purpose programming languages, the emergence of language-agnostic "virtual machines" that abstract away the machine, the relative ceiling of functionality we're finding on the current crop of object-oriented languages, and the promise and power of productivity of dynamically-typed or more loosely-typed languages, we're about to experience a renaissance of innovation in programming languages. Come hear why this is, and what practicing programmers need to do in order to ride the forefront--instead of the trailing edge--of this new wave in computer science.
