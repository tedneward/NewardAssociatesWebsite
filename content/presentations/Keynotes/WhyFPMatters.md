In the latter half of the 2000s, a new kind of programming language seemed poised to take the steam out of the dominancen of object-oriented programming languages and their hold over "mainstream" development. But these new languages, collectively referred to as "functional" languages, were nothing new. In fact, they've been a part of the language landscape since the late 80s, and arguably even longer than that. What makes a functional language, and what makes a functional language interesting? Most importantly, why do we care now, thirty years after their introduction?
