In 2000, Roy Fielding (he of REST dissertation fame. published a paper entitled 'Principled Design of Modern Web Architecture', in which he and his co-author described REST, how it achieved the goals of the Web, and cited examples. In this session, we’re going to do something of the same: talk not just about REST, but about the path that building an Internet-facing system should take, the reasons behind those choices, and the architectural implications that result from them. In other words, if you’re building a Web application in 2014, build it this way--or be ready to call it 'legacy' before it even hits the production servers.
