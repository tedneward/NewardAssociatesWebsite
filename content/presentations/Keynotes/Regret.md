"No regrets." It's a mantra that permeates so many messages we see and hear all around us. Celebrities swear they "don't believe in regrets", social media posts exhort you to "live a life of no regrets", even schoolteachers put up posters instructing children to "make decisions they won't later regret". Of all the negative emotions, regret is the worst.

And yet.... it turns out that regret does, actually, serve a purpose, and it's one that we as coders and career-minded individuals really should embrace.
