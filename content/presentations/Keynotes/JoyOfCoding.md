The ancient Greeks had a term, "eudaimonia", which, translated loosely, means "the good life". It is this concept of which Socrates spoke when he said that "the unexamined life was not worth living"; it is this same concept of which the Stoics spoke when the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote his "Meditations". Having a clear definition for what defines "the good life" is what brings many people a sense of fulfillment, accomplishment, and joy. So why is it so hard to find? And why is it that so many people in the software industry--and industry which, by all rights and measures, is one of the most successful on the planet--feel so far removed from it, whatever it is?
