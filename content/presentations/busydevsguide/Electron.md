What used to be known as the "Atom" text editor, built entirely in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, is now a desktop application development platform designed specifically for Web-tool-based development, but with all the bells and whistles that users have come to expect from desktop applications today: self-modifying updates, a sleek user interface, and a rapid development curve. In this presentation, we'll take a look at what building an Electron application looks like, how it works, how to debug one, and in general, get to know this interesting new space for building non-Web, non-mobile applications.
