Microsoft has one, Amazon has one, but it turns out that there's a lot of different developer-focused cloud environments out there, and sometimes it's exactly what you need to get your project going quickly--assuming you know it exists. In this session, we're going to take a survey of a variety of different cloud providers, many with wildly varying different approaches to "what developers need", and give you a series of ideas to explore the next time the boss says, "We need to move into the cloud!"
