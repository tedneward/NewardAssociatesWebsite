In the grand scheme of things, Prolog may seem like an odd language; it's never made the mainstream, it doesn't seem to address some of the more recent fad approaches, and it doesn't seem to promise some of the things (concurrency! scalability! actors!) that "modern" languages are pushing. But Prolog has some deeply powerful and unique features to it, particularly around the idea of decision-making, also known in some circles as "rules engines", and the fact that several different Prologs exist that run on top of more "modern" platforms (JVM, CLR, etc) means that Prolog can be a powerful tool in your tool belt when dealing with thorny decision-making problems that defy traditional imperative or functional approaches.
