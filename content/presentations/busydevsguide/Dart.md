Dart is a multi-platform language that deliberately seeks to "scale up" to building large applications for the Web, as well as mobile and IoT machines. It relies on a traditional C-family-language base syntax, provides some type checking, but retains much of the flexibility of a dynamically- or untyped language, and keeps objects at the core of the design process.

In this presentation, we'll go over Dart, its syntax, semantics, and some of the more interesting features it presents as a language, like optional typing and its built-in asynchrony features.
