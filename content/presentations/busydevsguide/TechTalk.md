The fear of public speaking actually exceeds the fear of death. (And the dentist.) But speaking to a group of technical peers can also be one of the most rewarding and career-enhancing things you can do. Whether it's a "brown bag" at your company, a local Meetup user group talk, or a conference presentation, there's a core set of tools and ideas that can make your talk look good, and we'll go over them, talk about their efficacy in a variety of different situations, and leave attendees with a core workflow to use for their next (or first) technical presentation.
