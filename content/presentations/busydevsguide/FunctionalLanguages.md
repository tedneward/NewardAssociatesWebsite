Developers have been hearing a lot lately about "functional programming languages" (langauges like ML, Lisp and Haskell) that have influenced both design thoughts and more recently-developed languages (like F#, Scala, and Clojure, to name a few). What's so interesting about these languages? Why does anybody care? And how hard is it to program without mutable state, anyway? In this presentation, we'll look at some of the fundamental concepts underlying functional languages, and see some examples in four of the more popular ones: F#, Scala, Haskell and Erlang.
