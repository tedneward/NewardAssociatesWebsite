"Developer Operations", or its more commonly-known nickname, DevOps, has taken the industry by storm. Everywhere you turn, everybody wants to be doing DevOps. It's the new black, the new normal, the thing that everybody clearly represents the next pinnacle in software development.... Except not everybody agrees on what it is, how to do it, or what benefits it will even provide you. In this presentation, we'll deconstruct the whole "DevOps" movement, talk about what it really represents, how to get started with it, and perhaps most importantly of all, talk about what is realistic to expect out of it once you have actually managed to "DevOps All The Things!" within your company.
