      Over the last decade, focus in inter-process communication has centered on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and its object-oriented equivalents. In this talk, we'll discuss the benefits of using another communication approach, messaging, to gain flexibility, scalability, extensibility, and other integration benefits that traditional RPC simply can't provide. We'll even talk about various messaging technologies and how they all relate to one another, including (but not limited to!) MSMQ, JMS, SOAP, and REST, among others.
