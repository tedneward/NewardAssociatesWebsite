With the dawn of the new decade, "cloud" swept into developers' (and their managers'!) mindsets with a vengeance. Suddenly, everything was "in the cloud", development was racing "to the cloud", and if you weren't "cloud-friendly", you were facing an uphill battle. And yet, with all this "cloud", nobody really sat down to think about how we architect systems for the cloud, or how it is (or isn't) different from building traditional "on-premise" (that is to say, not "in the cloud") applications. In this session, we'll do exactly that, taking a hard look at how cloud-based applications are similar to, yet very different from, traditionally-hosted applications.
