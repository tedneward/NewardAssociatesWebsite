Bugs? We all know your code has no bugs, but someday, you're going to find yourself tracking down a bug in somebody else's code, and that's when it's going to be helpful to make use of the wealth of tools that the Java Standard Platform makes available to you--tools that your IDE may not know exist, tools that you can make use of even within a production environment. Learn to use jdb, jconsole, jps, jstat, and other tools to identify and squash software defects that just won't reveal themselves during development. Then, just in case those tools aren't enough for you, we'll look at how to write your own, special-purpose tools using the same technology backplane.
