With the release of the OpenJDK source code, Java developers have been given a unique opportunity to peer inside the hood of the JVM, see what's there, and how Java code actually executes. In this presentation, we'll talk about how to get the OpenJDK codebase, how to compile it (for both Windows and Linux systems), and point out some of the more interesting aspects of the JDK source base. Developers will walk away with a deeper appreciation for exactly what happens when they run Java code. Innocents beware--we're a long way from "Hello, Java" with this one.
