With the growth of the Web, and a heightening awareness that we want to build more than just "Web pages" (namely, we want to build "platforms"), Java developers are becoming more and more often asked to build "platform APIs" using the HTTP protocol as the connector of choice. Because these APIs (sometimes called REST endpoints, though the debates rage on as to what exactly that means) are different than traditional JavaEE approach, and because Java developers all over are looking for simpler approachs in general, several new frameworks have emerged that deserve attention.
In this presentation, we will take a look at several of these frameworks, including how to get started with them, the basic approach they take to building a Web API/HTTP API/RESTful endpoint, the features they provide "out of the box", and why each is interesting.
