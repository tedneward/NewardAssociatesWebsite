Java bytecode is the code set used by the Java runtime (the JVM) that is JIT-compiled into native code at runtime. Find out how to read (and write) JVM bytecode directly, so as to better understand how the runtime works, and be able to disassemble key libraries that you depend on. This will also let you understand more about tools and libraries that can be used to manipulate Java bytecode directly, such as Javassist, ASM and BCEL, and why and when you might do this.
