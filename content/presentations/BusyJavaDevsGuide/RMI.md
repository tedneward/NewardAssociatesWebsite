Remote Method Invocation, or RMI, is at the heart of just about every distributed Java technology, from EJB to Spring to Jini. Learn the "how-to" of RMI, from the basics of "Hello, world" via RMI to the details of exported stubs and how clients can obtain those stubs through more than just the traditional rmiregistry agent. We'll even talk a bit about some of the customization options in the RMI stack, and RMI's nod to CORBA as a transport (RMI-over-IIOP).
