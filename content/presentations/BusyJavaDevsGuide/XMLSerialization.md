It's true that XML has become the standard representation for "portable data" across platforms and languages, but that doesn't mean it's always easy. Many developers find the process of generating XML documents by hand to be tedious and error-prone. Many also find the process of consuming (parsing) XML documents to be even worse, wading through callbacks and events, or navigating through node after node after node to find the data of interest. In this presentation, we look at toolkits designed to simplify that process by creating automated mappings of object-to-XML transformation in both directions.
