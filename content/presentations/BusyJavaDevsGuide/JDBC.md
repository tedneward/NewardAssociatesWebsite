For close to two decades, the Java Virtual Machine has had a deep and meaningful relationship with the relational database systems of the world through the JDBC interface. It may not always be the prettiest, or the easiest, but it's the foundation for every relational database data access API on the JVM today. In this session, we'll take a deep look at the JDBC API, what it provides, what it doesn't, and some of the various tools and libraries that are available to make JDBC programming a little less painful, long before ever needing to reach for an object/relational-mapping solution.
