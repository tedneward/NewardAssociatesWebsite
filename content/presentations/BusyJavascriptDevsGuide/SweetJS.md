With the rise of interest in JavaScript as more than just a hack to get the browser to do something more interesting than just plain HTML, a number of libraries have emerged to make it easier for developers to write code, whether intended for the server (Node.js) or the browser (jQuery). One of these libraries, SweetJS, provides a set of semantic macros (a la what we see in Lisps like Scheme and Clojure) to "extend" the JavaScript language in a variety of ways that would otherwise be difficult if not outright impossible to do with "stock" JavaScript, even to the point of allowing for the creation of domain-specific languages (DSLs) in JavaScript.
In this talk, we're going to talk about the feature set found in SweetJS, what it does, why it's there, and how to use it in your own applications.
