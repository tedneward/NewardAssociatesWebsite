With the rise of interest in JavaScript as more than just a hack to get the browser to do something more interesting than just plain HTML, and the parallel rise of interest in functional programming tactics and techniques, a strong desire to know how to program functionally in JavaScript has emerged, greeted by a chorus of "Why should I bother?" from the less zealous. In this talk, we'll examine some functional programming concepts, talk about the advantages (and disadvantages) of functional programming in general, and talk about how to approach and express functional ideas in everybody's favorite (or not so much) favorite dynamic language.
