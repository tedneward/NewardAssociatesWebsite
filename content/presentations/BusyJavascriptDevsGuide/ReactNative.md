Looking to build a native mobile application, but want to either leverage your skills as a Web developer (particularly if you're familiar with React), or the code you've already built for your React-based Website? Relax! Facebook has released unto us the ReactNative toolchain, for using the same principles as are used in React, to build native mobile applications.
In this session, we'll look at the basics of the ReactNative toolchain, how to use it to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android (including how to get all the right tools on your machine to make it all work), how to interact with the underlying device, and some of the pros and cons of choosing ReactNative over other similar tools, like Apache Cordova, or the native toolchains of each platform (ObjC/Swift and iOS, or Java and Android).
