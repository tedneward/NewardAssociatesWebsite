With the rise of interest in JavaScript as more than just a hack to get the browser to do something more interesting than just plain HTML, a number of libraries have emerged to make it easier for developers to write code, whether intended for the server (Node.js) or the browser (jQuery). One of these libraries, ExpressJS, is a package specifically geared towards providing a healthy collection of "middleware", meaning a set of standardized services on top of raw TCP/IP or HTTP sockets, making Express a common building block for building server-side Web (or otherwise) stacks.
In this talk, we're going to talk about the feature set found in Express, what it does, why it's there, and how to use it in your own applications.
