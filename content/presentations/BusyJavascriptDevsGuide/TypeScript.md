JavaScript: a dynamically-typed (or, as some consider it, entirely untyped) language and platform. TypeScript: a strongly-typed language designed to cross-compile/transpile to the JavaScript platform. Two things that couldn't be more dissimilar, intended to work together. In this session, we'll go over the syntax, semantics and implications of TypeScript, and more.
