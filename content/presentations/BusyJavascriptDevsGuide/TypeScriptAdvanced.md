TypeScript is mostly known for being a strongly-typed JavaScript. While this is certainly a viable view of the language, it ignores the view that TypeScript has a unique place among languages, that of being strongly-typed on top of a weakly/untyped platform. This enables TypeScript to do some language syntax and implementation that would be difficult, if not impossible, to do in traditional strongly-typed languages. In this session, we will explore some of these language features, see how we can design with them, and explore the beauty that is TypeScript on its own.
