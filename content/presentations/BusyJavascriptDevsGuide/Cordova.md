Apache Cordova was the first (of several) programming platforms that offered up a tempting concept: Build mobile applications using only the tools that any Web developer would know--HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Not surprisingly, it became quite popular, and we found it useful in places, less so in others.

In this talk, we'll go over Cordova--how it works, how to get started, and building some simple apps--and talk about its pros and cons, so that developers can make informed decisions about using Cordova against building mobile apps using native tools/languages for each platform distinctly.
