ECMAScript, better known by its original name, Javascript, remains one of the most popular--and misunderstood--programming languages in use today. While most developers see Javascript as a crippled form of its namesake (Java), it turns out that ECMAScript represents a powerful dynamically-typed language, easily equal to the other popular dynamic languages of the day (Python or Ruby).
In this presentation, we'll start looking at some of the O-O community's favorite design patterns (from the Gang-of-Four book as well as others) and examine their applicability to ECMAScript, including those patterns that work well here, those that don't, and a few new ones that wouldn't work well anywhere but here.
