The Loopback stack is a Javascript/NodeJS-based stack for building server-side API endpoints and middleware for building beautiful, simple, consistent API endpoints. A formal part of the NodeJS foundation, Loopback enjoys large corporate backing (IBM in this case), open-source cred (some of its original committers were key players in the ecosystem), and a (relatively) straightforward design approach.
In this talk, we'll dive into Loopback for building a NodeJS server, show how to create some endpoints, some database-backed entities, and do a little server-side control.
