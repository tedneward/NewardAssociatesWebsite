The Gang-of-Four collection of patterns has long served as a fundamental basis for object-oriented developers. TypeScript being an O-O language, it makes a certain amount of sense to see how we might apply the language to some of the traditional GOF patterns--and a few others besides. In this session, we'll explore how TS can simplify some of the traditional patterns, expand on them, and give us some additional tools in our arsenal against complexity.
