We often see various ongoing tasks--competing in business, building a system, or even just living a life--as a game, a kind of contest against various forces. James Karse, a modern philosopher, also sees various conflicts as games, with one caveat: Some games are "finite", in that the players are known, the rules are clear, and the end of the game is well-established and understood. Some games, however, are "infinite", and attempting to participate in an infinite game by assuming it is finite inevitably leads to failure.
Would it then come as any surprise to you that software development is an infinite game?
