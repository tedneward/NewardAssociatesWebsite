In 2008, the US economy took the sharpest nose-dive in living memory since the Great Depression. What started out as a localized rainstorm has quickly come to resemble a Category Five hurricane, a figurative "finger of God" storm of destruction that has swept through all industries, markets, and international economies with impunity, imprecision and impartiality. Developers face uncertainty, volatility and insecurity like never before.
