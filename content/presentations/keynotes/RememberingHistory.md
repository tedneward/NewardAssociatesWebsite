What do Imperial Germany, Napoleonic France, Czarist Russia, Web Services, OSF RPC and CORBA have in common? A lot more than you might think. History is filled with "learning opportunities" for those who are aware of it, and the history of distributed systems is no different. In this keynote, we'll examine the lessons of history--of both kinds--and learn how to draw interesting inferences for the future out of what's happened in the past. Don't let an ignorance of what has gone before lead you down an easily-avoidable path.
