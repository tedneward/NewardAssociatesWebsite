Functional programming--as implemented by languages like Erlang, Haskell or ML--saw a huge uptick in interest in the latter half of 2007 that has continued to this day. But even if you're not interested in learning a new programming language, we can still derive some powerful new techniques for writing code from functional ideas that will make your C# code that much better. In this presentation, we'll go over some of the basic concepts of functional programming--what it is, why it's different from O-O/imperative programming, and how it changes the programming experience--and see how to use various features of the C# language (and maybe a little Visual Basic) to make your apps more functional.
