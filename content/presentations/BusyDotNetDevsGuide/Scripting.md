Ever wished you could just put parts of your program in end-users' hands and let them build the infinite little changes they want? Ever thought about how you might make your application more robust by writing less code, not more? Embed a scripting engine into your application--complete with the safeguards necessary to ensure that users can't do anything they shouldn't be able to--and release yourself from the Principle of Perpetual Enslavement. This presentation will describe how to embed a scripting engine, discuss the pros and cons of the various ones available, and how to put enough safeguards around the scripts to make sure that your application can't be hijacked by bad users' scripts.
Note that this presentation can be customized several different ways, depending on the scripting language of choice--Iron Python, Iron Ruby, JavaScript, PowerShell or Lua.
