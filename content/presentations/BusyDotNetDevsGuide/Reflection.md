If you've never used Reflection (the System.Reflection namespace) before, you don't know what you're missing. In this presentation, we'll take a code-first, soup-to-nuts look at the .NET Reflection APIs, from how to examine the type metadata baked within every .NET assembly, to using custom attributes to enhance that metadata with your own information, even through the use of CodeDOM and Reflection.Emit to generate code (either at runtime or at build-time). Reflection represents one of the most powerful parts of the .NET environment; don't fail to exploit it just because you don't understand it.
