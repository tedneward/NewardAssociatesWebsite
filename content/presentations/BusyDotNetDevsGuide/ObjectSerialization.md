As simplicity-gets-you-power goes, .NET object serialization stands as one of the greatest wonders of the .NET world. Feed any arbitrary object graph to it to transform the graph into a stream of bytes, then deserialize back into objects again, all without any sort of interference or work on the part of the developer. But what if we need to make sure certain fields can't be seen during transmission? Or if we want to optimize the serialized object, for either speed or size? Far more power lies behind the Serialization APIs than just [Serializable], and in this session we will examine the customization capabilities of .NET's object Serialization.
