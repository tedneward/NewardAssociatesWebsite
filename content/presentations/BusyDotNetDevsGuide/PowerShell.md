Microsoft initially introduced the PowerShell command-line shell as a new tool for system administrators who were looking for a Windows equivalent to the powerful command-line script shells popular in the UNIX world, but in addition to making PowerShell .NET-aware, they also made PowerShell hostable from any .NET environment--including your own applications. In this presentation, we'll look at the PowerShell dynamic language, its deep integration with .NET, and how .NET developers can use this not only to build .NET applications, but extend their applications for others to customize and enhance.
