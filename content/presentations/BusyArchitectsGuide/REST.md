The Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style has taken the software development world by storm, profoundly influencing a number of different ideas and technologies, and its author, Roy Fielding, has laid down a fairly  strict description of whata REST architecture looks like. Is REST really the
wave of the future and the "last architecture" that any of us will work with? Or is there a more subtle, nuanced look at this architectural style that provides us with some interesting and compelling ideas for architecture, but acknowledging that it's just but one idea among many?
