The Comand/Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS) architectural style has emerged once again into the hallowed halls of software architecture, and it brings with it an entirely different approach to building/architecting software systems. Some of it makes sense; some of it baffles the newcomer. In this presentation, we'll talk about CQRS, where it fits, where it doesn't, some of the precepts by which we approach it, and most of all, how to get started with it if it turns out that this is the direction you want to take your next system.
