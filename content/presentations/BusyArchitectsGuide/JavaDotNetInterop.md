~~~~~~

Java and .NET represent the lion's share of enterprise development. In this talk, learn how the two environments can interoperate with one another, not only over web services, but also via in-process channels and other methods. Along the way, we'll talk about how to leverage the strengths of each, such as using Microsoft Office to act as a "rich client" to a Java middle-tier service, or building a Windows Presentation Foundation GUI on top of Java POJOs, or even how to execute Java Enterprise/J2EE functionality from within a Windows Workflow host.
