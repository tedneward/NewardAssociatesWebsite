In 2005, I published a book on how to go about building applications in the enterprise Java world more effectively, entitled "Effective Enterprise Java". Although the technology has changed some, the basic principles underlying the 75 items in the book have most certainly not. In this presentation (designed as an overview to all six sections of the book), we'll talk about some of those underlying principles, and how to avoid some of the downfalls and fallacies that frequently strike--whether they were written in 2005, 2015, or 1995.
