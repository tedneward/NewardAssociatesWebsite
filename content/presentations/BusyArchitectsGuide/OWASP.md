Application security, like all things computer-security-related, can be an overwhelming topic. In an attempt to help bring some of the infinite myriad security concerns under control, a group calling itself the "Open Web Application Security Project", also known as OWASP, has been managing and curating a series of talking points and/or considerations, the most widely-known of which is their "Top Ten Web Application Vulnerabilities" list. In this presentation, we'll examine the Top Ten, and how architects can use this as a "jumping-off" point to begin addressing the sticky (and huge) subject of application security.
