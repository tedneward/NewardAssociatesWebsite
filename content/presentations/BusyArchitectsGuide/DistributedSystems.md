Service-oriented, Representational State Transfer, Remote Procedure Calls, oh my!

If it's one thing the Computer Science industry has given us, it's a thousand different ways to communicate from one process to another. But all these options don't always come with a good user manual of which to choose at which times, or why one might work well in one scenario, and a different one in a different context. So in this session, we're going to go over all of the distributed system "space" from an architect's perspective, examining a variety of different approaches, comparing and contrasting each so as to get the "zen" of what it gives us, and talk about how it applies in several different scenarios. Don't come looking for easy answers--there are none. Instead, come prepared to do a little technical philosophizing, a little investigation, and a lot of learning.
