In the 90's, developers sought to build web pages. In the 2000's, it was all about web applications. But clearly the needle is still moving, and the technology keeps evolving. "Platform-Oriented Architecture" (or POA) is, very simply, what the next wave of software development is moving towards. In this workshop, we'll go over why that is, including what forces are driving us down this direction, and then spend time building out a simple platform, creating a model and a template for the kinds of POA projects that are to come.
