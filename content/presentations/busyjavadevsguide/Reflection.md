If you've never used Reflection (java.lang.reflect), you don't know what you're missing. In this presentation, we'll take a code-first, soup-to-nuts look at the Java Reflection APIs, from how to examine the class metadata that Reflection provides, to using annotations to enhance that metadata with your own information, even through the use of Java Dynamic Proxies to create flexible object "interceptors" that can layer services in front of ordinary method calls with nothing more complicated and an interface and a factory.
