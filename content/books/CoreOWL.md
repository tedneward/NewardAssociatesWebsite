This was the first of the two Object Windows Library (OWL), Borland's competitor to MFC, books that I wrote. The other was [Advanced OWL](./AdvOWL.html). Originally these were one book, but I wrote too much, and the publisher and I agreed to split it into two--this one, focused on the "core" aspects of the framework, and the other, focused on more "advanced" uses of the framework that were in many ways optional but interesting.

No, please don't ask where the code can be found--I've long since lost all my copies of it. However, I do believe the code lives on in an open-source project that keeps OWL up to date to this day.
