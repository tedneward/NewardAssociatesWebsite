Quite possibly one of the most unwieldy titles of all time, this book in many respects as the one I describe as my book on the Spring Framework... except I didn't know that I wanted to invent the Spring Framework (and obviously, therefore, didn't). It was very much similar in spirit to what Rod Johnson was describing in his "without EJB" book, which led him to write Spring. My own attempts at such were pretty half-hearted, and intended solely as inspiration, not production. (And it showed.)

But as a book designed to get people to understand the possibilities of the JVM for doing enterprise systems without resorting to EJB... yeah, it worked.
