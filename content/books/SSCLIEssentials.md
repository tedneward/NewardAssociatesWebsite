SSCLI Essentials was an in-depth, source-first look at the open-source version of the .NET Common Language Runtime; not ".NET Core", but the *first* one, the Shared Source CLI, code-named "Rotor".

We wrote it originally for Microsoft University, then wrote a second edition and released it free to the world, [here](http://www.newardassociates.com/files/SSCLI2.pdf).
