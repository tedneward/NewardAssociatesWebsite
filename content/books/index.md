A collection of the various books I've written over the years.

JVM books:

* [Effective Enterprise Java](EffectiveEnterpriseJava.html)
* [Server-Based Java Programming](SBJP.html)

.NET books:

* [SSCLI Essentials](SSCLIEssentials.html)
* [Professional F# 2.0](ProFSharp.html)

OWL (Object Windows Library):

* [Core OWL](CoreOWL.html)
* [Advanced OWL](AdvOWL.html)

There've been a few more with my name on them, but usually on those I either wrote just a tiny piece or else my work was repurposed to be a part of the book. These six are the only ones I really "lay claim" to having done significant work on.
