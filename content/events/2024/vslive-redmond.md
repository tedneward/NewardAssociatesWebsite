My time on the VSLive! tour continues with their annual summer trip to Redmond, WA, to talk to people on the Microsoft campus itself. This year, they've got me talking several technologies that may feel "fringe" to the average Microsoft developer:

* [Busy Manager's Guide to Interviewing](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyManagersGuide/Interviewing.html), a session in which I talk to (hiring) managers about how to intervew candidates successfully.
* Busy Developer's Guide to Esoteric Programming Languages, a 20-minute session on programming languages that you wouldn't inflict on your worst enemy, but are still fun to talk about, because somewhere, in history, some programmer actually invented this monstrosity.
* [Busy Developer's Guide to Next-Generation Languages](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/NextGenLangs.html), a session in which we talk about programming languages that were actually born in the 21st century.
