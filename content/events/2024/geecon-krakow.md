geeCon is becoming a staple event in Krakow, and given how much I enjoy the city, it's a given that if they ask, I'll look for a way to show up!

The website from their [2023 event](https://2023.geecon.com/) had some pretty interesting speakers, so I'm excited to see what this year's event brings.

Meanwhile, I'll be doing the closing keynote, presenting ["Why the Next *N* Years Will Be About Languages"](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/Keynotes/Languages.html). (Which, given all the interesting developments taking shape around LLMs, programming languages, and the need for faster iterations in our development cycles, definitely holds true!)
