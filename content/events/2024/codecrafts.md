The <Code/Crafts> conference, a group made up of several local user groups (JUG, DotNet UserGroup, ReactVienna, AngularVienna, and several others) has asked me to appear at their 2024 event, doing a keynote and (possibly) a workshop; more details to come as we sort out the details!

The website from their [2023 event](https://2023.code-crafts.com/) had some pretty interesting speakers, so I'm excited to see what this year's event brings.
