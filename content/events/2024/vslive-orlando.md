Once again, it's back to Universal in Orlando, to deliver the following:

* [Busy Manager's Guide to Interviewing](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyManagersGuide/Interviewing.html), a session in which I talk to (hiring) managers about how to intervew candidates successfully.
* [Busy Architect's Guide to the Fallacies of Distributed Systems](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyArchitectsGuide/DistributedFallacies.html), which is a session in which I examine and explain the fallacies, how they've manifested in 2024, and why they constantly surprise us

Should be fun!
