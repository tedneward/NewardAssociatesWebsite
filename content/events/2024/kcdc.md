Back again in the land of great BBQ, Andy Reid, and flat farmland--lots and lots of flat farmland. This time around, I'll be doing:

* [Architectural Katas Workshop](http://www.newardassociates.com/teaching.html): an 8-hour workshop practicing architecture as part of a small group. Come try out your architect chops, even if you haven't got any!
* [Busy Developer's Guide to Kotlin](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Kotlin.html): Kotlin has become the blessed-and-approved language for developing Android applications, but it's in no way limited to the development of Android. With Kotlin you can build JVM-hosted apps on the server, or even experiment with compiling to native across multiple platforms. In this session we'll explore the Kotlin language, tools, and how to get started with it.
