This time I'm coming to Chicago:

* [Busy Developer's Guide to Flutter](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Flutter.html), a session in which we take a quick look at the Flutter cross-platform framework and how to get started with it.
* [Busy Developer's Guide to Next-Gen Languages](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/NextGenLangs.html), a look at a number of interesting languages that are in a usable state (not necessarily production-ready) today.

Hope to see you there!
