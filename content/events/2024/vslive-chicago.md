This time I'm coming to Chicago, to give a few talks about a couple of topics:

* [Busy Developer's Guide to Next-Generation Languages](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/NextGenLangs.html)
* [Busy Developer's Guide to Flutter](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Flutter.html), a session in which we take a quick look at the Flutter cross-platform framework and how to get started with it.

Hope to see you there!
