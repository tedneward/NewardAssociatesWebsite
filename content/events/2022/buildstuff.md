BuildStuff is always on my list of "I really want to speak there" conferences. I've been asked to come speak again this year, doing a keynote (Iconoclasm), a workshop (an abbreviated [Architectural Katas](http://slides.newardassociates.com/Workshops/ArchKatas.html) workshop), and a session (on [Ballerina](http://slides.newardassociates.com/BusyDevsGuide/Ballerina.html)). UPDATE: They also asked me to speak at their pre-conference evening event before the conference even starts--how could I say no? The evening of 8 November, I'll be talking about Microsoft's entry into the actor market, [Orleans](http://slides.newardassociates.com/BusyDotNetDevsGuide/Orleans.html).
