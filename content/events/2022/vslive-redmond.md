VSLive! is a series of shows in the US, including this annual instance at the Microsoft campus in Redmond. (Building 33, if you know the campus.) Although the show tends to focus on .NET and SQLServer (and other Microsoft-invented tech), I often do talks that are well outside that ecosystem. This one will be no different, as I'm doing Python and Ballerina.

Talks:

* [VH15 Busy .NET Developer's Guide to Python](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Python.html)
* [VH19 Busy Developer's Guide to Ballerina](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Ballerina.html)
