The DevOps Days Des Moines and Agile Day Des Moines group are coming together for their first joint conference, and they've asked me to talk about [Iconoclasm](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/Keynotes/Iconoclasm.html) to their folks on Friday. It may sound strange, but I'm always a fan of Des Moines--when speaking on the No Fluff Just Stuff tour, we hit Des Moines every year. The show was always sold out or close to it, the audiences were always engaged, friendly, and sharp, and honestly? Taking a stroll through a cornfield is actually more relaxing than you might think.
