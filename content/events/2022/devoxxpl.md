DevoxxPL, in Krakow, is a wonderful event that I've had the privilege to do for a decade or more.

I'll be doing the [Quick & Dirty (&Right)](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/Keynotes/QuickAndDirty.html) keynote, in which we weigh the costs and benefits of "doing it right" vs "doing it quick", and when quick can, in fact, be the right choice. I'm also doing [a workshop on building a virtual machine](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/BuildingAVirtualMachine.html) (such as the JVM or CLR), where we'll build one from scratch--or at least the starting parts of one.
