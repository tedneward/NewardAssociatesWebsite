KCDC accepted my [Busy Developer's Workshop on Building a Virtual Machine](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/BuildingAVirtualMachine.html) workshop, in which I discuss hwo to build a virtual execution engine like the JVM or CLR (or any of a half-dozen other popular languages). In the workshop, we'll go over a simple, stack-oriented virtual machine with a simple bytecode set, implemented using Java or C#, depending on the participant's choice.
