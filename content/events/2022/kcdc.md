KCDC accepted my [Busy Developer's Guide to Building a Virtual Machine](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/BuildingAVirtualMachine.html) talk, in which I discuss hwo to build a virtual execution engine like the JVM or CLR (or any of a half-dozen other popular languages). The talk goes over a simple, stack-oriented virtual machine with a simple bytecode set, implemented using Java and fleshed out in front of the audience.
