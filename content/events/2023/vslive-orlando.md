Once again it's time to visit the Sunshine State and talk about:

* [Busy Architect's Guide to the Fallacies of Enterprise Systems](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyArchitectsGuide/EnterpriseFallacies.html)
* [Busy Developer's Guide to Flutter](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Flutter.html)
* [Busy Manager's Guide to Performance Management](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyManagersGuide/PerfMgmt.html)

And then I'll be part of a panel discussion: "Effectively Advocating for Yourself in a Vacillating Job Market"
