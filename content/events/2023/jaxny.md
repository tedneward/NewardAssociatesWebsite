The JAX conference brand has long been a staple of Europe, and now it comes to New York City to talk about all things architecture.

I'll be doing a session on [Ballerina](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Ballerina.html), an [Architectural Katas workshop](http://www.newardassociates.com/teaching.html), and then, one of my all-time favorite topics, [Why My International Relations Degree Tramples Your CompSci Degree](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/Keynotes/InternationalRelations.html).
