My time on the VSLive! tour continues with their annual summer trip to Redmond, WA, to talk to people on the Microsoft campus itself. This year, they've got me talking several technologies that may feel "fringe" to the average Microsoft developer:

* [Busy .NET Developer's Guide to Python](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Python.html)
* [Busy Developers Guide to Flutter](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Flutter.html)
* Fast Focus: [Busy Developer's Guide to Esoteric Programming Languages Session](http://www.newardassociates.com/presentations/BusyDevsGuide/Esolangs.html) (this is a much shorter session than normal, so it'll be an accelerated, whip-fast view of some of the most "interesting" languages you'll ever see)
