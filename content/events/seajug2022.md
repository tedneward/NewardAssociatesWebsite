The Seattle Java Userâ€™s group has been meeting since the mid-90s in the Seattle and Eastside area. It is geared towards topics related to the Java Virtual Machine and languages which run on it such as Java, etc. You can find us on https://www.meetup.com/seajug.

The talk I'm planning to give will talk about Java/native integration, beyond the basics of JNI and C/C++; I'm thinking to explore how to get Java to talk to some more "modern" native-compilation environments like Rust, Nim, Crystal, or maybe something else.
