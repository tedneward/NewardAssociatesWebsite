Sometimes, you just get an itch to explore a topic, and when you do, you don't want to let that time and effort go to waste, you know? So Ted decided to put a bunch of that research into some self-published articles, and threw them out onto the Internet.

Note that all of the papers listed below are copyright (c) Neward &amp; Associates, LLC, and are free to use for non-commercial purposes with appropriate attribution; they are available for use under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">"Attribution Non-Derivs Non-Commercial Creative Commons License"</a>. (I choose the Non-Derivs version because for papers, that would mean you could take the paper, change a few words, and re-release it, and that doesn't make sense for prose.) Please <a href="../pages/contact.html">contact us</a> if you have a use for them that might be commercial--usually there's no problem to grant usage rights, and has been done before.

*Keep in mind that some of these are close to 20 years old by this point; the JVM has gone through a LOT of revisions since I wrote them, and some may not be as pertinent and are here mostly for historical curiosity.*
